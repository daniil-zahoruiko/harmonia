# HARMONIA

HARMONIA is a music streaming application that allows users to discover and enjoy music in both Ukrainian and English languages. Users can also become creators and upload their own songs to share with the community. This project is built using Flask, MySQL, React.js, and Electron.js.

## Features

- Music streaming similar to Spotify.
- User account management and authentication.
- Bilingual support with options to switch between Ukrainian and English.

## Technologies Used

- **Flask:** The backend of the application is built using Flask, a lightweight and versatile Python web framework.
- **MySQL:** We use MySQL as the database management system to store user accounts, music data, and other essential information.
